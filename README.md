# Astro Bear Blog Theme

Create a blog with Astro based on the [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) styling.

Features:

- âœ… Minimal styling (make it your own!)
- âœ… SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- âœ… Markdown support

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
|   â””â”€â”€ bear-blog-theme.json
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

the components that make up the pages are in the  `src/components/` directory.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`.

The custom theme for the markdown rending of code blocks via Shiki is stored in the `bear-blog-theme.json` file. 

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
